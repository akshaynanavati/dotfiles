dotfiles
========

My configuration files for Mac OSX.

Usage
---

-Run `source install.sh` to configure both the dotfiles and mac osx settings.

-Run `./_make_symlinks.sh` only to get the dotfiles.

-Run `./_osx_defaults.sh` only to get the osx configuratoin options.

Note, if you want to use the bash_rofile provided in this repo, you must add
`source ~/.bash_profile_git` to your own bash config file.
